# Car Price Prediction Multiple Linear Regression 

**Car Price Prediction Multiple Linear Regression** is an all-in-one data analysis tool that simplifies data exploration, processing, and visualisation. It supports a wide range of data formats and enables efficient workflows for all types of data scientists. 


## Business Requirements
The business requires a predictive car pricing model that uses available independent variables to reveal how each factor influences price, enabling management to adjust design and strategy to meet target price levels while also gaining insights into pricing dynamics for new markets.

## Hypothesis And How To Validate
## Hypothesis 1.1: Bar Chart 
Car brand affect average car price.

## Hypothesis 1.2: Bar Chart
H1.2: Car Body Type influence the price ........

### Result:

## Hypothesis 2: Descriptive Statistics
Engine size , Car Space and Fuel Efficiency has positive correlations with price.

### Result:

## Hypothesis 3: 
Car prices vary significantly by manufacturing region.

### Result: 


## Project Plan
*Summarise the key stages followed during the analysis process
*Describe how the data was handled during collection, preparatio, analysis and interpretation
*Explain the rationale behind selecting the specific research methods used.

## The Rationale To Map The Business Requirements To Data Visualations
*The first visualisation is 
*The second visualisation is 
*The third visualisation is 
*The fourth visualisation is 

## Analysis Techniques Used
Prepare, validate and transform the data using Jupyter Notebooks.
Visualisations: Box plots, Bar Charts, Descriptive Statistics, Heat Maps.
PowerBI and Streamlit to create dashboards.

## Ethical Considerations
We followed the data regulations as this is very important with data analysis. There were no other ethical commitments we needed like anonymising data. 

## Planning
To ensure that everyone was on track we created a project board so that we could all see our tasks and make sure they were being updated (to do, in progress and completed) https://github.com/users/dumindagamage/projects/4/views/1 
 
 ## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Pandas
* Numpy
